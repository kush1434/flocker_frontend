    "Welcome to WebSockets! If you know some Python and JavaScript, you can now build apps that talk to each other live. Instead of just sending messages one at a time, WebSockets keep the connection open so the server and browser can share updates right away. This lets you make things like chat apps or live notifications that work without refreshing the page. Today, you’ll learn how to create a simple WebSocket server with Python and connect it to JavaScript on the browser."
